# Introduction

Welcome to the "Introduction to Software Engineering" learning module!

Think about the applications you use every day â€“ from social media platforms and mobile apps to complex enterprise systems. Have you ever wondered how they are built, maintained, and evolve over time? It's more than just writing lines of code!

This module will introduce you to the fascinating world of software engineering, a systematic and disciplined approach to developing software. While programming focuses on writing code to solve a specific problem, software engineering encompasses a much broader range of activities involved in building large, reliable, and maintainable software systems.

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  Understand the key differences between programming and software engineering.
2.  Understand the differences in project-based and product-based mindsets in software development.
3.  Describe essential technical tasks in software engineering, such as requirements elicitation, analysis, design, coding, testing, and acceptance testing.
4.  Describe typical development workflows used by software teams.
5.  Describe methods for project-based software development, such as using UML for upfront specification.
6.  Describe methods for product-based software development, such as agile methods and Scrum.

## Module Navigation

This module is structured into several sections, each covering a core aspect of software engineering. You can navigate through the sections using the menu on the left. We encourage you to engage with the interactive elements throughout the module to test your understanding and reinforce your learning.
