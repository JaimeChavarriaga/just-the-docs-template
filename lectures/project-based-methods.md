# Project-Based Software Development Methods

In this section, we will explore software development methodologies that are characterized by upfront planning and detailed specification before development commences. This approach is often referred to as project-based development.

## Introduction to Project-Based Methodologies

Project-based software development focuses on delivering a complete software system with a defined scope, timeline, and budget. The emphasis is on thorough planning and documentation in the early stages of the project.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

UML is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software engineering. It is used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software-intensive system.

UML diagrams provide different perspectives of the system being developed, allowing stakeholders to understand its structure, behavior, and interactions.

Some common UML diagrams include:

*   **Class Diagrams:** Show the static structure of a system, including classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among them.
*   **Use Case Diagrams:** Describe the functionality of a system in terms of actors (users or other systems) and the use cases (interactions) they perform with the system.
*   **Sequence Diagrams:** Illustrate the interactions between objects in a sequential order, showing the flow of messages between them over time.

In project-based development, UML is often used extensively to specify the software's design and architecture before coding begins.

## Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model is a classic example of a traditional, project-based software development methodology. It is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before the next phase begins.

The typical phases of the Waterfall model are:

1.  **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** Defining what the software should do.
2.  **System Design:** Designing the overall architecture and components.
3.  **Implementation:** Writing the code.
4.  **Testing:** Verifying that the software meets the requirements.
5.  **Deployment:** Releasing the software to users.
6.  **Maintenance:** Ongoing support and updates.

While simple to understand, the Waterfall model can be rigid and makes it difficult to incorporate changes once a phase is completed.
